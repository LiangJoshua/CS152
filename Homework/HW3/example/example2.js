// This example is using a standard JS design pattern to hide variables.
// The balance variable is captured as a closure.  Critically, it is
// **not** a field of Account objects.  Instead, getter/setter fields
// are used to provide access to that variable.
//
// As a side-effect, some challenges of writing contracts for objects
// are nicely side-stepped.  Note that this example includes a contract
// specifying details about "private" data.


// Note: An 'import' feature is available for ES6,
// but it does not yet seem to be implemented for Node.js.
